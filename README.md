## About The Project
This is a simple Python package to calculate the convex hull of
a given set of points. The package wraps a single function to
calculate the convex hull of a given set of points using divide &
conquer algorithm. This project is made to fulfill
`Tugas Kecil 2 IF2211 Strategi Algoritma`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
to build the package from source.

### Installation
To build the package, you will need to do the following steps.

1. Run
```
py build/all.py
```
2. Wait until the building process is finished.

During the build process, you may encounter a message saying that
you have installed another Python package named `myConvexHull`.
To solve this, you will have to first uninstall the `myConvexHull`
package. See [Uninstalling](#uninstalling).

## Usage

To calculate the convex hull of a given set of points, you need
to import `convex_hull` function from the package and pass an array
of the points. A point is an array that contains two floating point
values. Hence, the `convex_hull` should receive a two-dimensional
array of floating point values.

The `convex_hull` function will calculate the points that construct
the convex hull of the given array of points. The points returned
by the function is a subset of the array of points, thus having
the same data type. You can plot this array of points using `pyplot`
module from the `matplotlib` package to visualize the convex hull.
Here is an example program that calculate the convex hull of 10
random generated points, as can be seen in the [documentation](https://mych-docs.web.app/).

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from myConvexHull import convex_hull
from myConvexHull.point_utils import X, Y
points = np.random.randint(-30, 30, [10, 2])
hull = convex_hull(points)
points = np.transpose(points)
hull = np.transpose(hull)
plt.scatter(points[X], points[Y])
plt.plot(hull[X], hull[Y])
plt.show()
```

## Uninstalling

If you wish to uninstall the package, you can run
```
pip uninstall myConvexHull
```
or run the uninstall script.
```
py build/uninstall.py
```
